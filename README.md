# 🏬 Super Mall Web Application

Hello! This is a fully working shopping mall website I built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Firebase**.

It’s designed like a real mall. People can explore shops by floor, view and compare products, add to cart, and place orders.  
Shop owners (merchants) can register their shop, add products, and manage offers. Everything runs in real-time using Firebase!

## 🌟 What Can You Do on Super Mall?

- Add items to cart and checkout  
- Choose **Cash on Delivery** or simulated Razorpay/GPay  
- Track your order location on a map (📍Leaflet + OpenStreetMap)  
- Submit and view product **reviews and ratings**

### 🧑‍💼 As a Merchant:

## 🧱 Tech Stack I Used (Explained Simply)

🧑‍🎨 **Frontend:**  
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the design and functionality. Simple, powerful, and under full control.

🔐 **Login System:**  
Firebase Authentication lets users and merchants log in securely — no backend needed.

📦 **Database:**  
Firebase Realtime DB stores products, shops, offers, orders, reviews — and updates instantly.

🗺️ **Map Integration:**  
Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (free & easy!) instead of Google Maps that asks for cards and APIs 😤  
*"Google: Add a card to continue..." Me: Bro I just want to show a map 😭"*

💳 **Payment System:**  
I wanted to use Razorpay, but they asked for a business certificate — I’m just a student!  
So I simulated payment with a popup instead 😂

🌐 **Testing:**  
I used Live Server in VS Code for fast reload and testing.

☁️ **Hosting:**  
Deployed on Firebase Hosting + GitHub Pages for showing it off online 😎
